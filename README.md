# **CUDA and C Learning Project**

Welcome to the **CUDA and C Learning Project**! This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with **C** programming and **CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture) to accelerate applications using GPU processing.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Introduction**

C is a powerful systems programming language that is widely used for developing operating systems, compilers, and performance-critical applications. CUDA, developed by NVIDIA, extends C with parallel computing capabilities for GPUs (Graphics Processing Units).

This project is structured to help you understand and apply core concepts of both **C programming** and **CUDA** for high-performance computing.

## üöÄ **Technologies**

- **C**: A low-level language widely used in system and application development.
- **CUDA**: NVIDIA's platform for parallel computing that harnesses the power of GPUs for high-performance tasks.

## üèóÔ∏è **Project Structure**

- `/src`: Contains all the source code for C and CUDA programs.
- `/docs`: Documentation and learning resources.
- `/examples`: Example programs to demonstrate key concepts in C and CUDA.
- `/build`: Compiled binaries.

## üìö **Topics Covered**

### C Programming:
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Control Structures (Loops, Conditionals)
- Functions and Recursion
- Pointers and Memory Management
- Structs and Unions
- File Handling
- Dynamic Memory Allocation

### CUDA Programming:
- Basics of GPU Architecture
- CUDA Memory Model
- Writing and Running a Basic CUDA Kernel
- Thread Hierarchy and Block Management
- Optimizing GPU Memory Access
- Parallel Reduction
- Error Handling in CUDA

## üßë‚Äçüíª **How to Run the Project**

### Prerequisites
To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **CUDA Toolkit** (Latest version: [Download here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit))
- **GCC** for compiling C programs
- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support

### Compilation and Execution

#### For C Programs:
```bash
gcc -o program_name src/program_name.c
./program_name
```

#### For CUDA Programs:
```bash
nvcc -o cuda_program src/cuda_program.cu
./cuda_program
```

## üìù **Examples**

### C Program: Vector Addition
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 7;
    int sum = a + b;
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
```

### CUDA Program: Vector Addition
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void add(int *a, int *b, int *c) {
    int index = threadIdx.x;
    c[index] = a[index] + b[index];
}

int main() {
    int a[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int b[5] = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    int c[5] = {0};

    int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_a, 5 * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_b, 5 * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_c, 5 * sizeof(int));

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, 5 * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, 5 * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    add<<<1, 5>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c);

    cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, 5 * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    printf("Vector addition result: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", c[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    
    return 0;
}
```
